            <h2>Learning Python</h2>
            <p>I've been embarking on the exciting journey of learning Python for a while now. This project will be devoted to showcasing some of the problems I'm working on.</p>
            <p>I have tried various programs and websites for learning Python, and the best part is most of them are free. I found a great program through the University of Helsinki where they have a massive online course catalog that is free to anyone who wants to learn! MOOC.fi (https://www.mooc.fi/en/) has been great.</p>
            <p>They use Microsoft Visual Studio and TestMyCode to make it easy to go through the exercises, test your code, and figure out any problems via the errors. 
                Highly recommend.</p>
            <h3><time datetime="2024-03-22"></time>March 22, 2024</h3>
            <p>I've worked my way through the Intro parts (1-7) and have begun the "Advanced" course in programming. It's been great, and brings me back to my earlier days in 
                high school when I took classes in Java and C++. Python is way easier to understand though. This Advanced portion has been focused so far on object, classes, and
                the relation between the three of them. Methods have also been at play fairly heavily to reiterate many of the introductory lessons and the importance of
                where items are placed. Here's some code that I worked on recently that was showing how objects are able to be used as attributes.</p>
            <pre>
                class Person:
                    def __init__(self, name: str, height: int):
                        self.name = name
                        self.height = height

                    def __str__(self):
                        return self.name

                class Room:

                    def __init__(self):
                        self.people = []

                    def add(self,person: "Person"):
                        if person.name != None:
                            self.people.append(person)

                    def is_empty(self):
                        if self.people == []:
                            return True
                        else:
                            return False
                        
                    def print_contents(self):
                        if self.people != []:
                            total_height = 0
                            total_people = len(self.people)
                            for person in self.people:
                                total_height += person.height
                            print (f"There are {total_people} persons in the room, and their combined height is {total_height} cm")
                            for person in self.people:
                                print (f"{person.name} ({person.height} cm)")
                        else:
                            return "No people in the room!"

                    def shortest(self):
                        if self.people != []:
                            short = 999
                            index = 999
                            for person in self.people:
                                if person.height < short:
                                    short = person.height
                                    index = self.people.index(person)
                            return self.people[index]
                        else:
                            return None

                    def remove_shortest(self):
                        if self.people != []:
                            short = 999
                            index = 999
                            for person in self.people:
                                if person.height < short:
                                    short = person.height
                                    index = self.people.index(person)
                            removed = self.people.pop(index)
                            return removed
                        else:
                            return None
            </pre>
            <p>You can see that two classes are declared, and one gets used with the other as it's object. There was also some logic in there to figure out the shortest person.
                Whenever I'm writing that kind of logic I'm always thinking to myself, "I bet someone can do this way easier!" Sometimes I'm sure that's true, other times I thinking
                certain problems just require a decent amount of logic to solve.</p>

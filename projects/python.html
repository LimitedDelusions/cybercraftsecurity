            <h2>Learning Python</h2>
            <p>I've been embarking on the exciting journey of learning Python for a while now. This project will be devoted to showcasing some of the problems I'm working on.</p>
            <p>I have tried various programs and websites for learning Python, and the best part is most of them are free. I found a great program through the University of Helsinki 
                where they have a massive online course catalog that is free to anyone who wants to learn! MOOC.fi (https://www.mooc.fi/en/) has been great. Part of this project and 
                the reason I want to share what I'm working on is for my own accountability, but also for any other learners out there that are starting with Python and run into the 
                same topics. At least they will see the path that I took. It also helps me a lot to have to reiterate what I'm learning and explain it.</p>
            <p>MOOC uses Microsoft Visual Studio and TestMyCode to make it easy to go through the exercises, test your code, and figure out any problems via the error messages.
                Highly recommend.</p>
            <h3><time datetime="2024-03-29"></time>March 29, 2024</h3>
            <p>I started working on these problems again after taking a short break for the NCL Practice Game. This lesson was focused on the scope of class methods and gave some insight
                into scope and namespaces. Suffice to say, namespaces are areas where variable names or other names are not able to be repeated without causing conflict. Scope is similar
                if you're thinking of the scope of a name (variable, definition, class), but in this lesson the point was pressed was that the scope can refer to what is visible to a certain
                portion of the program. A lot of this was defined with the example of a private method within a class, and the lack of accessbility outside of that class. I could see as well
                how a local variable within a method could reuse a name multiple times if similar functions were being done within those methods (account transactions, math, etc). Here's <thead>
                code that I wrote for this exercise, showing how to add a service charge to an account when depositing or withdrawing from it:
            </p>
            <pre>
                class BankAccount:

                    def __init__(self,owner: str,acct: str,balance: float):
                        self.__owner = owner
                        self.__acct = acct
                        self.__balance = balance

                    def __str__(self):
                        pass

                    def deposit(self,amount: float):
                        if amount > 0:
                            self.__balance += amount
                            self.__service_charge()

                    def withdraw(self,amount: float):
                        if amount > 0 and self.__balance > amount:
                            self.__balance -= amount
                            self.__service_charge()

                    @property
                    def balance(self):
                        return self.__balance
                    
                    def __service_charge(self):
                        if self.__balance > 0:
                            self.__balance = self.__balance - (self.__balance * 0.01)
            </pre>

            <h3><time datetime="2024-03-25"></time>March 25, 2024</h3>
            <p>I learned about encapsulation today with Python, which is about hiding attributes from clients. Seems very privacy (and by association security) oriented, which is 
                nice because there hasn't been a lot of content focused on much security yet. Encapsulation works by using private attributes within a class. This allows the developer
                to only allow access to variables by the use of the class' methods. The authors of the class did not that Python hidden attributes are not necessarily inherently secure,
                though, and there are ways around that. I looked into this briefly and found there was another "protected" technique using a single underscore, but immediate results
                did not indicate a way around the private attribute, though I'm sure there are some. I'm excited to learn more about that at some point, but for now I've got to stay focused
                on learning the basics of this language. Here's the small program I made for this exercise:
            </p>
            <pre>
                class Car:
                    def __init__(self):
                        self.__petrol = 0
                        self.__odometer = 0

                    def __str__(self):
                        return f"Car: odometer reading {self.__odometer} km, petrol remaining {self.__petrol} litres"
                    def fill_up(self):
                        self.__petrol = 60
                    
                    def drive(self,km: int):
                        for x in range(km):
                            if self.__petrol > 0:
                                self.__odometer += 1
                                self.__petrol -= 1
            </pre>
            <p>After learning about the encapsulation for attributes in classes, the course went on to explain 'getter' and 'setter' properties for methods within a class. These are used to 
                access the private attributes within a class as well. The @property decorator is used before a method to define it as a getter, and then the .setter is used after that to
                define a setter. The private attributes can then be retreived or set by the client as if accessing the attributed directly (even though they're not.) Here's the small program
                that I made based on the getter and setter attributes:
            </p>
            <pre>
                class Recording:

                    def __init__(self, length:int):
                        if length > 0:
                            self.__length = length
                        else:
                            raise ValueError("The amount must not be below zero")
                    
                    @property
                    def length(self):
                        return self.__length
                    
                    @length.setter
                    def length(self, length):
                        if length > 0:
                            self.__length = length
                        else:
                            raise ValueError("The amount must not be below zero")

                if __name__ == "__main__":
                    the_wall = Recording(43)
                    print(the_wall.length)
                    the_wall.length = 44
                    print(the_wall.length)
            </pre>
            <p>One of the interesting items I learned about encapsulation, is that you don't have to let the getter/setter decorators be accessible to the client/public, and you can just 
                use them internally in the class, while making publicly available methods for the client to use. 
            </p>
            
            <h3><time datetime="2024-03-22"></time>March 22, 2024</h3>
            <p>I've worked my way through the Intro parts (1-7) and have begun the "Advanced" course in programming. It's been great, and brings me back to my earlier days in 
                high school when I took classes in Java and C++. Python is way easier to understand though. This Advanced portion has been focused so far on object, classes, and
                the relation between the three of them. Methods have also been at play fairly heavily to reiterate many of the introductory lessons and the importance of
                where items are placed. Here's some code that I worked on recently that was showing how objects are able to be used as attributes.</p>
            <pre>
                class Person:
                    def __init__(self, name: str, height: int):
                        self.name = name
                        self.height = height

                    def __str__(self):
                        return self.name

                class Room:

                    def __init__(self):
                        self.people = []

                    def add(self,person: "Person"):
                        if person.name != None:
                            self.people.append(person)

                    def is_empty(self):
                        if self.people == []:
                            return True
                        else:
                            return False
                        
                    def print_contents(self):
                        if self.people != []:
                            total_height = 0
                            total_people = len(self.people)
                            for person in self.people:
                                total_height += person.height
                            print (f"There are {total_people} persons in the room, and their combined height is {total_height} cm")
                            for person in self.people:
                                print (f"{person.name} ({person.height} cm)")
                        else:
                            return "No people in the room!"

                    def shortest(self):
                        if self.people != []:
                            short = 999
                            index = 999
                            for person in self.people:
                                if person.height < short:
                                    short = person.height
                                    index = self.people.index(person)
                            return self.people[index]
                        else:
                            return None

                    def remove_shortest(self):
                        if self.people != []:
                            short = 999
                            index = 999
                            for person in self.people:
                                if person.height < short:
                                    short = person.height
                                    index = self.people.index(person)
                            removed = self.people.pop(index)
                            return removed
                        else:
                            return None
            </pre>
            <p>You can see that two classes are declared, and one gets used with the other as it's object. There was also some logic in there to figure out the shortest person.
                Whenever I'm writing that kind of logic I'm always thinking to myself, "I bet someone can do this way easier!" Sometimes I'm sure that's true, other times I thinking
                certain problems just require a decent amount of logic to solve.</p>

            <h2>Learning Python</h2>
            <p>I've been embarking on the exciting journey of learning Python for a while now. This project will be devoted to showcasing some of the problems I'm working on.</p>
            <p>I have tried various programs and websites for learning Python, and the best part is most of them are free. I found a great program through the University of Helsinki where they have a massive online course catalog that is free to anyone who wants to learn! MOOC.fi (https://www.mooc.fi/en/) has been great.</p>
            <p>They use Microsoft Visual Studio and TestMyCode to make it easy to go through the exercises, test your code, and figure out any problems via the errors. 
                Highly recommend.</p>
            <h3><time datetime="2024-03-22"></time>March 22, 2024</h3>
            <p>I've worked my way through the Intro parts (1-7) and have begun the "Advanced" course in programming. It's been great, and brings me back to my earlier days in 
                high school when I took classes in Java and C++. Python is way easier to understand though.</p>
